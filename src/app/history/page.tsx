        <p className='p-3 m-2'>The Japanese Army invaded and ruled Korea from 1910 through the end of World War
II. During that period, it was not uncommon for Korean families and treasures to be
relocated to Japan. During the Japanese occupation a young boy, Yong Sool Choi, was
sent to Japan. By age 9, Yong Sool Choi was alone and living with a group of monks in
a Buddhist temple. Shortly thereafter, it became apparent to the monks that Yong Sool
Choi was not suited for monastic life. 
<br /><br />

At this tirne, urany great warriors, in accordance with ancient traditions, undertook
annual pilgrimages throughout Japan to improve their martial arts skills. During their
travels they visited local temples to offer prayers and donations. One such warrior,
Master Sokaku Takeda, paid regular visits to the monastery where Yong Sool Choi
resided. During one of Master Takeda's visits, the resident monks, seeing an opportunity,
beseeched Master Takeda to take the young Choi as a disciple.
<br /><br />

Master Takeda practiced the art of swordsmanship and a weaponless martial art known
as Daito-Ryu Aiki Jujitsu. This art emphasized the use of joint locks, strikes, and nerve
attacks to neutralize an opponent. Daito-Ryu Aiki Jujitsu, itself, originated from the
united Silla Dynasty of Korea. Sam Lang, Won Eui Guang, a Korean bureaucratic
official, taught this art to Japan's Minarnoto Shogunate, the ruling family of Japan
during the Karnakura feudal era in the mid 900%. The Shogunate, in return, passed the
art to members of the Takeda Clan where it remained for over 33 generations. Master
Sokaku Takeda was a 37th generation practitioner.
<br /><br />


The young Choi served as Master Takeda's personal rnanservant and, in that capacity,
was privy to the lessons Takeda provided to all levels of students of his style of unarmed
combat; including the most senior students of Daito- Ryu Aiki Jujitsu.
<br /><br />

Yong Sool Choi remained in Japan for 35 years training under Master Takeda. After
Takeda's passin«, near the end of World War II, Yong Sool Choi returned to Korea and
opened a small school in Taegu, the third largest city in Korea. Ile began training a small
group of students informally. Yong Sool Choi is credited with the founding of modern
day Ilapkido.
<br /><br />

Ilapkido Boxing was founded in 2008 and II BIO is the officially recognized body for
Hapkido Bo.xing for international Competitions. the Ilapkido Bo.xing (II BIO) systems

art and Korean Traditional martial art Although Hapkido Boxin€r and Hapkido are
closely related, they are two very different sports. "I'he tnain difference is that in Ilapkido
Boxing Use Boxing Ring for competitions. its Sparring Principles Are very Different. we
would definitely say that Ilapkido has a more aesthetic, fast-paced, and flashy art aspect
to it SS hereas Ilapkido Boxing is tnore about the art of how the hurnan body could
generate maxirnum power with the Inner body(KI) techniques that Ilapkido Boxin€v
teaches. there is definitely more depth to the differences between Ilapkido and Ilapkido

Ilapkido is known as Korean because of Yong Sool Choi from South Korea). Ilapkido
Boxing is a popular sport in the developing countries due to its simplicity, easy to
comprehend rules and public appeal. </p></div>
